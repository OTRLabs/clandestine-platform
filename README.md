# Conti Platform | Attribution Evasion & Anonymity Preservation PoC

## Introduction

This project is a proof of concept for a `platform` that explores the use of a variety of technologies for an *organization* to conduct *offensive* `cyber security operations`, where the evasion of attribution and the preservation of anonymity is a high priority.

The `platform` is designed to be used by security researchers, penetration testers, and other professionals in the field of cybersecurity.

The `platform` is built around the idea that we need to be able to assess what `threat actors`

I have heard debate about whether or not attribution matters. In my extremely unqualified opinion, I believe that it does.
I do not think it is logical to pursue every user of the pirate bay, I just think that if we want to live in civilized society, being able to identify the perpetrator of, say a hospital breach, which can put lives at risk
