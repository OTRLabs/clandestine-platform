# Conti Platform | Attribution Evasion & Anonymity Preservation PoC
## Introduction

This project is a proof of concept for a `platform` that explores the use of a variety of technologies for an *organization* to conduct *offensive* `cyber security operations`, where the evasion of attribution and the preservation of anonymity is a high priority.

The `platform` is designed to be used by security researchers, penetration testers, and other professionals in the field of cybersecurity.

The `platform` is built around the idea that we need to be able to assess what `threat actors` are capable of, in order to better defend against them.


Also, I just think this would be fun.

### Attribution Matters

I have heard debate about whether or not attribution matters. In my extremely unqualified opinion, I believe that it does.

I do not think it is logical to pursue every user of the pirate bay. I just think that if we want to live in civilized society, being able to identify the perpetrator of, say a hospital breach, which can put lives at risk, is important if we intend to make the internet & IT such a critical part of our society's infrastructure. 

Long story short, the information & software in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. I am not responsible for any misuse of the information or software provided in this repository.

Honestly, I cannot even begin to articulate how stupid it would be to use this platform for anything illegal. It would make the prosecutor's life very easy if they got their hands on, what is essentially a database logging all of your activities.

If you are working within the law, this is useful & valuable information. If you are not... ðŸ¤·
