### Document Storage
- Format: Preferably JSON, however content & information should be in markdown format, to be beautiful when rendered in the UI
- S3 via Seaweed FS: stores documents
- DuckDB for the relational database + vector store + document index
- Docker containers to deploy scripts & applications that return data
