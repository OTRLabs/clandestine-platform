TL;DR: we will self host open source models. There is just no reason to use 3rd party APIs, where these tokens add up. If you want to use faster LLMs maybe we will offer a cloud platform 

I am going to have Ollama be the standard choice. The open source nature + model files for building highly optimized models is great! This combined with fabric will make for effective chat, analysis and summarization 

We will use hugging face for decision making if it comes to that
